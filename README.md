### This is a tutorial I am doing to understand dApp's better.

It is a staking application.

Users receive X amount of tokens for depositing there own ethereum.

Solidity, Truffle, Javascript, React used.

Understanding how to use tokens, how hard it is to distribute them, the current limitations of dApps, and the opportunities they present is my interest in this project!
